The Polyhouse Automation System is an advanced monitoring and control solution designed to optimize agricultural efficiency and improve crop management. The system leverages modern technologies to monitor and control key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity within a polyhouse environment. This project demonstrates the potential of automation to enhance productivity, reduce manual intervention, and maintain optimal growing conditions.

The system incorporates sensors such as the DHT22 for temperature and humidity monitoring, along with soil moisture and light intensity sensors to provide real-time data acquisition. Multiple sets of sensors, totaling 4 to 5, were implemented with Arduino Uno to ensure comprehensive monitoring and a better understanding of the polyhouse environment. Each Arduino unit collects data from its designated sensors and transmits this information to the ESP8266 module using the NRF24L01 wireless transceiver module. The ESP8266 processes the received data and sends it to a Firebase Server for remote monitoring and control.

A custom Android application was developed using MIT App Inventor to monitor and control the polyhouse environment remotely. The app connects to a Firebase Server, providing a centralized database for data storage and synchronization. This allows users to view real-time sensor readings, receive alerts, and issue commands to manage environmental conditions effectively.

The development process included circuit design and PCB layout using EasyEDA, ensuring compact and reliable hardware implementation. Embedded C programming was employed to configure sensor data acquisition, communication protocols, and actuator control. The use of Firebase ensures scalability, enabling future enhancements like predictive analytics and advanced reporting features.

Applications of the Polyhouse Automation System include smart farming, greenhouse management, and precision agriculture. Key advantages of the system include increased crop yield, reduced water and energy consumption, remote monitoring, and reduced labor costs. Future enhancements could include solar power support for sustainable operation.

In conclusion, the Polyhouse Automation System offers an innovative and cost-effective approach to modern agriculture. Its advanced monitoring and control features enable farmers to create ideal growing conditions, improve resource efficiency, and enhance productivity. With further upgrades, this system can serve as a scalable solution for smart farming applications.

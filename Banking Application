Error Handling: Avoid problems like withdrawing too much money or invalid user input; the application performs error checks to avoid such issues.

Backend logic: The backend logic of the application was developed using C++ with the knowledge of Object Oriented Programming handling different bank operations.

File Handling: Utilized for persistent storage of user data, transaction records, and account details between sessions.


Outcome:

A console-based Banking system that is simple, secure and efficient to perform the basic banking functionality.

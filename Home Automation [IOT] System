The IoT Home Automation and Temperature Monitoring System is designed to provide users with the ability to control home appliances remotely via a smartphone application, while also offering real-time temperature monitoring. The system integrates IoT technology to control appliances such as lights and fans from anywhere, enhancing user convenience and flexibility. It also features a temperature sensor, which continuously monitors and displays the real-time home temperature, letting users track their living environment. The mobile application was developed focusing on providing a seamless, user-friendly interface that ensures users can easily control appliances and access temperature data. Firebase Server was used to store the data, including the synchronization and storing of user preferences, appliance states, and temperature data for ease of access through any device. The system hopes to make the management of a home easier with better control of appliances and climate, potentially reducing energy usage and making living in the home much more comfortable. It uses hardware elements like microcontrollers (for example, Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32), relay modules to manage appliances, and temperature sensors like DHT22 and LM35. This project provides a foundation for developing even more robust automation systems and adding more devices in the future.
